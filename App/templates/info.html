        What is ph level?
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          The pH of water is a measure of the acid–base equilibrium and, in
          most natural waters, is controlled by the carbon
          dioxide–bicarbonate–carbonate equilibrium system. An increased
          carbon dioxide concentration will therefore lower pH, whereas a
          decrease will cause it to rise. Temperature will also affect the
          equilibria and the pH. In pure water, a decrease in pH of about 0.45
          occurs as the temperature is raised by 25 °C. In water with a
          buffering capacity imparted by bicarbonate, carbonate and hydroxyl
          ions, this temperature effect is modified (APHA, 1989). The pH of
          most drinking-water lies within the range 6.5–8.5. Natural waters
          can be of lower pH, as a result of, for example, acid rain or higher
          pH in limestone areas.

        What is Hardness?
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          The simple definition of water hardness is the amount of dissolved
          calcium and magnesium in the water. Hard water is high in dissolved
          minerals, largely calcium and magnesium. You may have felt the
          effects of hard water, literally, the last time you washed your
          hands. Depending on the hardness of your water, after using soap to
          wash you may have felt like there was a film of residue left on your
          hands. In hard water, soap reacts with the calcium (which is
          relatively high in hard water) to form "soap scum". When using hard
          water, more soap or detergent is needed to get things clean, be it
          your hands, hair, or your laundry.

        What is the standard hardness value range for a potable water?
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          For potable water (water that is safe for drinking and meets
          regulatory standards), there is no strict limit on water hardness.
          However, water with moderate hardness is generally considered safe
          for consumption(120-200 milligrams), and many people find it acceptable. Extremely hard
          water may have taste and odor issues, but it is not typically a
          health concern. It's important to note that different regions and
          countries might have their own guidelines and regulations regarding
          water hardness. If you are concerned about the hardness of your
          drinking water, you can contact your local water utility or testing
          laboratory for specific information related to your location.

      <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          TDS means concentration of dissolved particles or solids in water.
          TDS comprises of inorganic salts such as calcium, magnesium,
          chlorides, sulfates, bicarbonates, etc, along with many more
          inorganic compounds that easily dissolve in water.

          It's important to note that these are general guidelines, and
          specific regulations or recommendations may vary based on local
          standards and regulations. The World Health Organization (WHO)
          suggests that a TDS level of up to 600 mg/L is generally acceptable
          for drinking water. However, taste preferences can vary, and some
          people may find water with higher TDS levels less palatable.

        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          Chloramines (also known as secondary disinfection) are disinfectants
          used to treat drinking water and they: Are most commonly formed when
          ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water. Provide
          longer-lasting disinfection as the water moves through pipes to
          consumers. Chloramines have been used by water utilities since the
          1930s.

          While chloramines are effective disinfectants, some people may be
          more sensitive to the taste or odor associated with chloraminated
          water. In such cases, using activated carbon filters or allowing
          water to stand for a short time before use can help reduce the
          presence of chloramines.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
          (EPA) regulates the levels of disinfection byproducts, including
          chloramines, in drinking water. The Maximum Residual Disinfectant
          Level (MRDL) for chloramines is set at 4.0 milligrams per liter
          (mg/L) or 4.0 parts per million (ppm).

      <div class="accordion-item-body">
        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          Sulfate (SO4) can be found in almost all natural water. The origin
          of most sulfate compounds is the oxidation of sulfite ores, the
          presence of shales, or the industrial wastes. Sulfate is one of the
          major dissolved components of rain. High concentrations of sulfate
          in the water we drink can have a laxative effect when combined with
          calcium and magnesium, the two most common constituents of hardness.

          sulfate in drinking water is 250 mg/L (milligrams per liter). This
          guideline is set based on aesthetic considerations, specifically to
          avoid a laxative effect that may occur at higher sulfate
          concentrations.

        <div class="accordion-item-body-content">
          Conductivity is a measure of the ability of water to pass an
          electrical current. Because dissolved salts and other inorganic
          chemicals conduct electrical current, conductivity increases as
          salinity increases. Organic compounds like oil do not conduct
          electrical current very well and therefore have a low conductivity
          when in water. Conductivity is also affected by temperature: the
          warmer the water, the higher the conductivity.

          treatment plant releasing treated sewage into the stream. Organic carbon comes from
          the breakdown of natural organic materials and synthetic sources. Water containing less

          of THMs is considered safe to drink. They are formed when natural organic material, such
          as the decaying vegetation commonly found in lakes and reservoirs, reacts with chlorine
          used to treat the water. This reaction produces “disinfection byproducts,” the most
          common of which are THMs.
